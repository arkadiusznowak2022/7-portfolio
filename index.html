      <h2>About me...</h2>
      <p>
        Through the last years programming was a member of my life, sometimes in the shape of a hobby, sometimes as a part of my work. A few things happened that brought me to the place where I have chosen my final programming language, took a few courses and decided to be a 100% programmer. I have lived in the Netherlands for about 3 years. This portfolio shows bigger projects  in chronological order that I was making during my learning for the front-end developer, technologies that I was working with and my breadth of experience with different languages.

          <h4>1. Sudoku Solver</h4>
          <p class="project-desc">
            I made this app before I even started to prepare myself better in HTML and CSS. App is able to solve basic sudoku's and more advanced one's, where you need to make an assumption because every field finally has at least two solutions. Sudoku Solver is made with <strong>MVC structure</strong>.

          <p class="project-desc">
            My first practice where I was focusing on <strong>styling</strong> and also the first responsive web app. Elements are written <strong>by hand</strong>, I didn't plug in ready-to-use solutions like bootstrap.

          <p class="project-desc">
            Web app based on <strong>Leaflet library</strong> which provides managing responsive maps. Also I used <strong>API</strong> communication to receive data about places marked on the map and names of those places are added to new memories. Keyboard events like the 'Del' button are described after loading the page.

              <h3>Arduino</h3>
              <p>
                Here my adventure with programming begins, while I was working in the Technology department as the specialist, in AIC company in Poland. My specialisation was laser beam welding and I was responsible, among others, for creating welding processes and building new automatic welding stations in cooperation with robotic engineers. I was spending time in my office with C++ programmers. They offered to teach me programming Arduino’s microcontroller. I learned how to do it with different devicements like distance sensors, led panels etc. It started to be a hobby for me at that time.

              <h3>C++</h3>
              <p>
                After Arduino I felt that I like programming, but I want more. That’s why I started to learn C++. With my professional colleagues' support I learned the basics, in a procedural and object oriented way, and later (after my skills were approved by my team leader) I was writing small applications for robot operators. They were using it for reporting quantities, imperfections, and describing common problems. Then with my algorithms I was performing this data for automatic reports for our departure. After some time I got a promotion and unfortunately I had no more time for programming anymore – different priororities.

              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>
                When I was living in the Netherlands I started to learn Java at home as a hobby. Few months of different courses allowed me to write my own applications. I was creating GUI with the Scene Builder and main logic with plane Java. I decided to build my own portfolio, new CV and look for a job as a Java programmer but the first few months of pandemy were a hard time for new programmers so finally I decided to stay in previous work (in unpredictable times, I kept to a safe solution) and try again later.

              <p>
                I was working in Koni (Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands) for more than 2 years as a welding robot specialist. Here I was responsible for welding with automatic processes, setting up a few robots and sometimes, making programs in Rapid language, which is used for programming behaviour of ABB robots. I was using my knowledge which I collected in Poland, when I was working in the Technology department plus I learned how to use Rapid in every day experience.

              <p>
                At the beginning of this year I decided to focus my mind on being the front-end developer. At first I mastered the online course made by Jonas Schmedtmann, which was focusing mostly on JavaScript with CSS and HTML as the support. Later I signed up to polish academy of coding Akademia108, which I graduated with distinction for my abilities as the new junior developer. I made a lot of smaller applications in different technologies and a few bigger ones - and these ones I attached to my portfolio.
